Installation is more complex than most addons<br>
It consists of multiple parts best done with my installer<br>

I wouldn't call it easy to use. Significant amount of time is needed inside PATHs.txt and FOLDERs.txt<br>
It is made both to recognize almost all games as I have no idea about future games.<br>
At my peak I had almost 2000 games installed so it became a bit sluggish the more installed games you added.<br>
The main purpose of the installer is to install more games. One way is the install button the second way is to double click in the left list<br>
Uninstall preserves every thing about a fix mainly reshade.ini and ShaderFixesGeo3D as well as ShaderCacheGeo3D.<br>
Double-clicking on the right opens up the main exe folder for a game where Geo3D etc is installed. So to modify reshade.ini it's there.<br>
Path button just shows the path  on the game on the left. OpenGL is not yet present in Geo3D hoping to add it soon.<br>
DX9 and DX10+ are exclusive and hard to get wrong. Sometimes DX12 is needed but it is obvious when DX10+ fails.<br>
